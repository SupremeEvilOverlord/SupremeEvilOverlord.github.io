      <h2>Post #1 Internet Arcade</h2>
      <h5>Jan 29, 2021</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
      <p>The game I chose to play from the internet arcade was Shadow Dancer. My experience during play was hard but fun to play. I struggled to remember the joystick controls during the in-game play, which ended up with my score of 2500 points (Yes I know I terrible at this game, but I’m proud of this low score of mine).
Now the graphics for Shadow Dancer were amazing since this game was created in 1989 which was the start of highly detailed pixelated games because in 1980 most of the graphics were simplistic and minimalistic but made gameplay a lot easier to understand how to play the game, but over time the graphics evolved with more complex storylines which brought us Shadow Dancer. Not only are we blessed with highly detailed pixelated graphics from the normal 8-bit screens we also gained a storyline that was played while waiting for us to insert in our coins to start the gameplay.
Stage one was by far the hardest stage for me mainly because I kept dying from the shooter’s bullet, but when I did kill him, I usually got killed by the gang bang of refugees either because I was not throwing my shurikens fast enough or I forgot how to command the dog to go attack the enemy.
The difference between playing on an emulator vs on the arcade cabinet is very noticeable. While only having a few buttons and a joystick made it easy to control the game while gaining speed to fight and get higher scores, with the laptop you have to figure out the controls yourself if it’s not posted in the description or comments; as well as it slows down the speed of gameplay as well and may start to cause disinterest in the game caused by the frustration of lack of knowledge.</p>

      <h2>Game Lab #1</h2>
      <h5>Feb 11, 2021</h5>

      <p>I played “I Doubt” and “Klondike Solitaire” during Game lab 1. During “I Doubt” there was a bit of confusion at the beginning because of setting up as well as deciding who would go first, second, and etc. Once those small kinks were figured out the game begun. The match was quite tense as we started figuring out the count and who was going to be the first to be doubted, but unlike everyone else I was very confused by the rules which I didn’t know then would screw me over in the long run of the game, as having an unsure and doubtful voice would be the only way I wouldn’t get doubted as every time I spoke with a confidence I would be doubted as you can see on the session sheet when Shania and Kyra doubt me. Though I do have to say figuring out if someone is lying over zoom was reasonably hard as you can see in the session sheet when I doubt Calvin’s 5 and end up taking all the cards again. </p>
