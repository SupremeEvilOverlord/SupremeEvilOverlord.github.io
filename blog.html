      <p>The game I chose to play from the internet arcade was Shadow Dancer. My experience during play was hard but fun to play. I struggled to remember the joystick controls during the in-game play, which ended up with my score of 2500 points (Yes I know I terrible at this game, but I’m proud of this low score of mine).
Now the graphics for Shadow Dancer were amazing since this game was created in 1989 which was the start of highly detailed pixelated games because in 1980 most of the graphics were simplistic and minimalistic but made gameplay a lot easier to understand how to play the game, but over time the graphics evolved with more complex storylines which brought us Shadow Dancer. Not only are we blessed with highly detailed pixelated graphics from the normal 8-bit screens we also gained a storyline that was played while waiting for us to insert in our coins to start the gameplay.
Stage one was by far the hardest stage for me mainly because I kept dying from the shooter’s bullet, but when I did kill him, I usually got killed by the gang bang of refugees either because I was not throwing my shurikens fast enough or I forgot how to command the dog to go attack the enemy.
The difference between playing on an emulator vs on the arcade cabinet is very noticeable. While only having a few buttons and a joystick made it easy to control the game while gaining speed to fight and get higher scores, with the laptop you have to figure out the controls yourself if it’s not posted in the description or comments; as well as it slows down the speed of gameplay as well and may start to cause disinterest in the game caused by the frustration of lack of knowledge.</p>

      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
      <p>I played “I Doubt” and “Klondike Solitaire” during Game lab 1. During “I Doubt” there was a bit of confusion at the beginning because of setting up as well as deciding who would go first, second, and etc. Once those small kinks were figured out the game begun. The match was quite tense as we started figuring out the count and who was going to be the first to be doubted, but unlike everyone else I was very confused by the rules which I didn’t know then would screw me over in the long run of the game, as having an unsure and doubtful voice would be the only way I wouldn’t get doubted as every time I spoke with a confidence I would be doubted as you can see on the session sheet when Shania and Kyra doubt me. Though I do have to say figuring out if someone is lying over zoom was reasonably hard as you can see in the session sheet when I doubt Calvin’s 5 and end up taking all the cards again. </p>

      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
      <p>Play session #1</p>
      <p> My partner and I only starting with five pawns, a spinner that went from one to ten, and checkered board in which we only moved on the whites and not blacks.
Basic Rules: The person with the most pawns at the end wins. I was fine with these rules at first and wanted to have more of a challenge so I added more pawns and a bigger board to bring more time and using addition for any extra pawns during attacks (ex +1 or +3) and also having a single colored board instead of the checkered board.</p>
      <p> Play Session #2
Playing this game with my family by far was torture, mainly because it just wasn't challenging enough for them, in the original. While the game was in play my two players Kira and Jordan had no strategy at first only to take out all the players. After the first round ending in a tie and nobody losing a pawn they kept playing. Now through out the game they kept making comments about how they wanted to add or lose a player in-game or be able to flee so then the game could last longer than ten minutes and become more challenging. In which I added in power cards  to help with this situation. These power cards being: skip, lose a player, add a player, extra roll, and flee! </p>
      <h4>"Powercard because the power cards are too over powered.</h4>
      <p>Play Session #3
This portion was the true test to see if Powercard would work as a two player game in which it did.
As we played there was no strategy during the first round but once the second round hit the power cards had too much power, so instead of giving the player 5 cards at the start and pulling a new card after using one power card it ended with starting with 3 instead. I also took out using leftover moves to add into attack, so it forces the player to think of a strategy and use more pawns in game play and fights. </p>

      <p>Missed messages - “dating” sim type of game, in which you send memes and go on a date or talk to to your roommate or work, now this game clearly has a message at the end about depression and suicide and wants you to choose to hang out with goth girl first before you realize the dreadful mistake that you missed at the. Beginning of the game. Once I took a different route ignoring the goth girl and instead of paying more attention to prevent what happened the first time I played, while until I got a better ending.
Aesthetic: horror, romance, simulation, causal 
Dynamics: choosing how the conversation is led, multiple options to choose from,
Mechanics: having a shift in how you view each conversation and dynamic will foresee how the ending is.</p>
       <p> May I take your order- “dating” sim type of game
https://alexisroyce.itch.io/may-i-take-your-order 
The first round I survived by just listening to what my two customers would talk about  (Hendrick and Talaiporia) which were the hints and clues to get me to the end: the hug. The next ending I get with this game is sweet and dreams truly making me question if the fear of my avatars death can occur, but with the humor of the two customers, it keeps the player intrigued and into the game instead of being bored.
Aesthetic: horror, comedy, dating sim, monsters
Dynamic: you are the one choosing the meal for Talaiporia and Hendrick. Three options to choose from and many reactions.
Mechanics: Depending on what you feed and speak to Talaiporia will affect if you will be getting a sweet tip or an outrageous public display of affection. </p>
       <p>Sort the court:
https://graebor.itch.io/sort-the-court 
Aesthetic: simulation, fantasy, kingdom,
You need to get a bigger population, have your people be happy, and still have enough money to where you're the one in charge trying to help become the best ruler you can be. Now me I was dumb enough to get scammed by making a deal with the devil and this 
Dynamic: swipe left or swipe right on people, you have to get to the celestial board
Mechanics: with saying yes or no to players you can either gain or lose money, happiness, and population. </p>
       <h4>" From the player ís perspective, aesthetics set the tone, which is born out in observable dynamics and eventually, operable mechanics. </h4>
       <p>These three games they all real in more than one way some relate more than others. The games Missed Messages and May I take Your Order, these two games do act the same in gore,  horror, as well as being a romance sim even though in missed messages you are the roommate, while in can I take your order you are the server for your guests. Both games using hints and clues to allow you to (hopefully) choose the correct choice and hopefully get the best end route. Now how does Sort the Court play into is well because of it being a simulation you have to choose what is the correct choice to help better your kingdom or else you will suffer just like in missed messages if you chose to go on the date you may just find your roommate dead? With the comedy of the names and questions, the characters ask you it becomes highly  enjoyable and addictive just like May I take your order with the crazy hysterics of Hendrick and Talaiporia, trying to get the best meal by using the player’s recommendations. </p>
