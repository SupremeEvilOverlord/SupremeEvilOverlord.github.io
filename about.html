Howdy! I am Alexis Lienhard, I am a Junior, and perusing the Digital Media Art Major at San Jose State University. </h5> 
<br>
 <h1 style="font-size: 30px">The Journey</h1> 
 <br>
<h5 style="text-align: left; font-size: 20px;">I've been doing art for as long as I remember from digitally on my Wacom to my laptop and if it wasn't digital it was physical art like painting or sketching. At one point I even ventured into drumming and guitar, to help create and understand sound and audios effect in art as well.
 <br> 
Starting at broadcasting as a freshman in highschool to graphic design my senior year of high school. I interned the summer of 2018 as a graphic designer for Lovegevity. I was the graphic designer for SJSU's VS/PINK Campus Rep Club, I designed t-shirts for the San Jose State cheerleading team, I did the promotional photos, videos, and graphics for Spartan Spectrum Danceteam, and now I'm the Director of Social Events for Delta Gamma Sorority.</h5>

     <h1 style="font-size: 30px">My Goal</h1>
    <br>
<h5 style="text-align: left;font-size: 20px">
  Let’s change the perspective with how we see life. What keeps me coming back to the studio, the sketchbook, the laptop is to tell a story for those who are misunderstood and unheard in this society, who see the world in a different way from others. 
  Why is what all my viewers ask once they see each piece in fascination, the surprise of what I think and feel in my artwork. 
  The best way to describe my artwork is as one person said “these were hard for me to look at, but this is what people portray them as” making me know that my viewers and critics understand the trauma, the emotion, and the humanity of my artwork without alot of explanations. 
  So why don’t we change the perspective by bringing light into the truth and meaning of our everyday lives, while the other is to set be set free and release us from the fears that hold us back
