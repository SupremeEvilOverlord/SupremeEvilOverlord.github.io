        We all hide something about ourselves, I create art to bring
        light into the truth and meaning of our everyday lives. My
        work explores the relationship between trauma, emotions, and
        humanity. As trauma comes in different forms that cannot
        always be told in the same way; slowly the emotional
        connections between humans change, as people only show how
        they act versus how they internally feel; by doing this we
        as humans become desensitized to our emotions and we slowly
        start to lose the uniqueness of what made us who we really
        are as humans. <br>
        Each piece of artwork tells a story of its own part of my
        life. My Graphic design work is a portrayal of my life
        growing up and how I wanted to feel. The need to be perfect
        brought out the core basics of who I was on the outside. A
        girl from the valley, trying to change the perspective of
        how people see life and the emotions in it. <br>
        My new media Artwork portrays the loss of social
        interactions from a false reality we create for ourselves,
        with artificial intelligence. It shows how we use it to the
        point where it can be addictive, dangerous and lead to our
        downfall. My photography speaks levels upon the trauma I
        have experienced in my life, but haven’t spoken out about.
        “Uncovering the Self” shows the trauma that is taboo and you
        cannot speak about. While my photo work in “GoodBye” speaks
        of many forms of mental illnesses that everyday people deal
        with daily but are afraid to speak out about. These people
        are afraid of opening up, seeking help terrified of the
        after-effects of how people may treat them. The film portion
        goes deeper into depth when these feelings of trauma
        continue to be hidden and eventually get out of control.
        Fine-art of my emotions towards others, by allowing myself
        to express my outer emotions towards others. By creating the
        wire heart, that is open and has color throughout, reminds
        us of the beauty and energy that flows in something so
        precious to keep us alive. The crossbow while it may be made
        out of cardboard and gives the illusion of something that
        may be weak, it's actually the opposite and it’s used to
        protect the heart. <br>
        My art is for the people who feel unheard, who want to
        change the perspective. Who wants to tell people to stop
        judging a book by its cover. Get in there and read the
        entire story. <br>
        Let’s change the perspective of how we see life. What keeps
        me coming back to the studio, the sketchbook, the laptop is
        to tell a story for those who are misunderstood and unheard
        in this society, who see the world in a different way from
        others. <br>
        My viewers' reaction once they see each piece of my work is
        pure fascination. They are surprised by what I think and
        feel in my artwork. The best way to describe my artwork is
        as one person said “These were hard for me to look at, but
        this is so necessary to see”, making me know that my viewers
        and critics understand the trauma, the emotion, and the
        humanity of my artwork without a lot of explanations. So why
        don’t we change the perspective by bringing light into the
        truth and meaning of our everyday lives, we need to be set
        free and release ourselves from the fears that hold us back.
